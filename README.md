In [one of my blogposts](https://trygvevea.com/2018/01/28/Extending_the_OpenStack_-_Part_I_APIs/), I walk through how you can create a simple microservice that uses keystone for authentication.
This repository contains a really simple "Hello, World"-kind of webservice that does this.

Do with it what you will, at your own responsibility.
